In this tutorial, we are going to use `lavaan` for confirmatory factor analysis. The examples correspond to the self-concept CFA example in your course slides.


## Load the pacakges

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
```

<br>


## Import the data

The data for this example is saved in a csv file named "proficiencyraw-female.csv", which is provided as part of the course materials. You can use the `read.table()` function to read in a csv file. There are many different ways for you to supply the file path in the `read.table()` function call. Below I first set the working directory to the folder where my data is saved, and then I simply supply the name of the data file in the function call. 

```{r,echo=F}
mypath <- "/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/Dpr/EDMS workshops/SEM2019/SEM First Course Mplus 2019/Mplus Examples"
```

```{r}
setwd(mypath)  # change it to the path of your own data folder
data <- read.table("proficiencyraw-female.csv", sep=",", header=F)

# give variable names
colnames(data) <- c(paste0("goals",1:6), 
                    paste0("rsc",1:5), 
                    paste0("hsc",1:5), 
                    paste0("msc",1:5), 
                    paste0("ssc",1:5), 
                    "SATvoc", 
                    "SATcomp", 
                    "SATlang", 
                    "SATmath", 
                    "SATprob", 
                    "SATproc")

```

You can take a look at the data and get the sample statistics.

```{r}

head(data)
str(data)

# sample means
apply(data, 2, mean)

# sample correlations
knitr::kable(cor(data))

```

## Example 1: Four factor self-concept model

We first fit a four factor model to the data. 

```{r, echo = F, warnings = F, message = F, out.width='80%'}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)

setwd(mypath)  # change it to the path of your own data folder
data <- read.table("proficiencyraw-female.csv", sep=",", header=F)

# give variable names
colnames(data) <- c(paste0("goals",1:6), 
                    paste0("rsc",1:5), 
                    paste0("hsc",1:5), 
                    paste0("msc",1:5), 
                    paste0("ssc",1:5), 
                    "SATvoc", 
                    "SATcomp", 
                    "SATlang", 
                    "SATmath", 
                    "SATprob", 
                    "SATproc")
cfa.Model <- '

```

### Write the model syntax

We use the model syntax to tell `lavaan` what model we want to fit. Different from our previous MLR and MVPA examples, we now have latent variables that are not observed in the data. For `lavaan` to recognize the latent variables, we must define each of them using the special operator "`=~`", which is followed by the indicators of the latent variable being defined. You can read the "`=~`" operator as "is measured by".

In our example, we have to define 4 latent variables: RSC, HSC, MSC, and SSC. By default, `lavaan` will fix the loading of the first indicator to 1 (similar with Mplus).


```{r}
cfa.Model <- '

# measurement model

RSC =~ rsc1 + rsc2 + rsc3 + rsc4 + rsc5
HSC =~ hsc1 + hsc2 + hsc3 + hsc4 + hsc5

# covariances between the latent variables

MSC ~~ SSC

'

```

<br>

### Fit the model to the data

We can still use the `sem()` function for CFA. You just need to simply supply the model syntax and the data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfa.Fit <- sem(cfa.Model, data = data)

```

<br>

### Summary the results

Next you can summarize the results using the `summary()`function. To get more info on the model fit measures, you can use the optional argument `fit.measures = TRUE`. To take a look at the standardzied parameter estimates, you can use the optional argument `standardized = TRUE`. Unstandardized solutions are displayed in the column labled "Estimate". The standardized solutions are listed in the column labeled "Std.all".

```{r}
summary(cfa.Fit, fit.measures = T, standardized = T)
```

## Example 2: Second-order self-concept model

In this example, we fit a second-order factor model to the data. 

```{r, echo = F, warnings = F, message = F, out.width='80%'}

cfa.Model.2='
RSC=~rsc1+rsc2+rsc3
HSC=~hsc1+hsc2+hsc3
MSC=~msc1+msc2+msc3

'

cfa.Fit.2=sem(cfa.Model.2,data=data)
semPaths(cfa.Fit.2, title = FALSE, curvePivot = TRUE, intercepts = F)

```

### Write the model syntax

We first define the first-order latent factors, as we did in the previous example. The second-order latent factor "GENERAL" is also defined using the "`=~`" operator. Its indicators are the first-order latent factors. We can free the factor loading by multiplying the indicator with `NA`, such that lavaan knows that the value of this parameter is not fixed and needs to be estimated. We then fix the variance of the second-order latent factor to be 1, by multiplying it with 1 in the variance formula. 


```{r}
cfa.Model.2 <- '

# measurement model 

RSC =~ rsc1 + rsc2 + rsc3
HSC =~ hsc1 + hsc2 + hsc3
MSC =~ msc1 + msc2 + msc3
SSC =~ ssc1 + ssc2 + ssc3

# second-order latent factor

GENERAL =~ NA*RSC + HSC + MSC + SSC
GENERAL ~~ 1*GENERAL

```

<br>

### Fit the model to the data

We can still use the `sem()` function for second-order CFA. You just need to simply supply the corresponding model syntax and the data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfa.Fit.2 <- sem(cfa.Model.2,data=data)
```

<br>

### Summary the results

Next you can summarize the results using the `summary()`function. To get more info on the model fit measures, you can use the optional argument `fit.measures = TRUE`. To take a look at the standardzied parameter estimates, you can use the optional argument `standardized = TRUE`. Unstandardized solutions are displayed in the column labled "Estimate". The standardized solutions are listed in the column labeled "Std.all".

```{r}
summary(cfa.Fit.2, fit.measures = T, standardized = T)
```

## Example 3: Residualized factor model

In this example, we fit a residualized factor model to the self-concept data. 

```{r, echo = F, warnings = F, message = F, out.width='80%'}

cfa.Model.3='
RSC=~rsc1+rsc2+rsc3
HSC=~hsc1+hsc2+hsc3
MSC=~msc1+msc2+msc3

'

cfa.Fit.3 <- sem(cfa.Model.3,data=data)
semPaths(cfa.Fit.3, title = FALSE, curvePivot = TRUE, intercepts = F, optimizeLatRes = T)

```

### Write the model syntax

The residualized latent factor "GENERAL" is defined by all the measured variables. We can free the factor loading by multiplying the first indicator with `NA`. `lavaan` thus is told that the value of this parameter is not known and needs to be estimated. We then fix the variance of the residualized latent factor to be 1, by multiplying it with 1 in the variance formula. 

We also fix the covariances among the latent factors to be 0. In order to do that, we multiply the variables by 0 in each of the variance formulas.


```{r}
cfa.Model.3 <- '
